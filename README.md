 Hosties+ is a fork of [ENT_Hosties](https://github.com/Sples1/ENT_Hosties/) ([AlliedModders](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=307634)), which is a fork of [SM_Hosties](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=108810), a Jailbreak/ba_jail plugin with lots of features like lastrequest.

## Stable and beta versions
Stable versions can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/azalty/sm-hosties-plus/releases).

Beta/dev/untested versions, which often contains the latest patches and upgrades but can be buggy and unstable, can be found in the `main` branch. They're not recommended unless you were advised to try them or you know what you're doing.

Beta versions might also end up as releases with a yellow mention "Pre-release" and "BETA" in their version name.\
This will be done when a beta version needs more testing and is considered more stable than the `main` branch.
